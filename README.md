KMeansClustering.py
KMeansClustering implementation for dynamic amount of clusters, points, and iterations. Initializes amount of points specified using np.randn function. Generates 3 .png files in the same folder as the .py file consisting of initial points, first iteration of clusters and points assigned to clusters, and final iteration of clusters and points assigned.
